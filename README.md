# Employee-Compensation-in-SF
This folder contains Employee Compensation dataset for the city of San Francisco, California and python script which analyses compensation, benefits, and their relationship with different departments of the city structure for years 2013-2016. A blog post describing this project in details is published at this website.

 * numpy (1.19.5)
 * pandas (1.1.5)
 * sklearn (0.22.2.post1)
Data Visualisation
 * matplotlib (3.3.4)
 * seaborn (0.11.1)
  
# Project Motivation

The model tries to predict the salary based on employee's rank, department, job family, and other postion details. This project would help city administration to set salaries and benefit amounts to city employees and incoming people.

# File Description
The files included in this project are:

Salary_Employees_SF_linear_model.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook including the main project code.
Employee_Compensation_SF_0.csv - csv file containing part 1 of Employee Compensation SF data

# Project Summary
This project is a study about salaries of city employees in the city of San Francisco, and it tries to find answers to the following  business questions:

1. What is the most profitable profession in the city system?
2. Do people who earn more get higher percentage of their compensation in benefits than lower income?
3. Do people who work overtime tend to earn more or less than average?
4. What are the professions / Job titles who earn average amount of money?
5. What percentage of city employees receive benefits through work? If some do not, what are job titles?

Within this analysis we found what are the most paid employees, who are top 1% and top 10 employees in the city system. We studied what is the relationship between total compensation and amount in benefits, what is the correlation between overtime and salary, and how many city employees do not receive benefits through work. We have also built a model to predict total compensation amount for every department in the city system
